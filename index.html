Unfortunately, my health was still a bit up and down. I decided to try something different. There is a pretty cool bar here in Bloomington called The bishop. I can always count on three or four killer shows to come through a year, and tickets are usually under $20. Its the kind of venue where if one shows up early, there is a good chance of kicking it with the very musician(s) about to play. It’s a small venue where everyone gets really sweaty, and the place just smells like body odor by the end of the show. It reminded me of when I was first starting out, shooting bands at double door and Metro in Chicago.
