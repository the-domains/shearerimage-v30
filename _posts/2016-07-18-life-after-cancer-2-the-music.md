## Life After Cancer \#2 (the Music)

Years ago, before I got sick, I knew who I was. I was a photographer. I travelled, I partied, I photographed the bands I loved to listen to (and many bands I couldn't stand as well.) For me, I just wanted to be behind the camera, and the photo pit is usually the best seat in the house. I was constantly meeting new and interesting people. Beautiful women wanted to talk to me at rock shows. Over time, some of the luster wore off, and it definitely felt like a job. However, when I lost my vision. When I lost the use of half my body... It was hard to imagine I would ever get back in the pit again.

Eventually, after about a year, my vision returned. My therapies continued, and I continued to heal and regain more function of my body. I photographed one of my biggest heroes, calvin Johnson. A friend got me credentialed to photograph the Stone Temple Pilots. I photographed my friend's band, tammar. I discovered I could, in fact, take pictures again. I am fortunate to live in Bloomington, IN. Yes, it is surrounded by Indiana, but it is an island in many respects. I have always loved music, and this town draws many up and coming acts. At first, I started going to shows of bands that I like who were playing in town. I had never really been to any shows without a camera, so I couldn't get comfortable at torro y moi or foxygen. Both shows were great, but it just felt weird to not have my camera at my side. Years went by.

I toyed with the idea of getting back into work, hitting the road to follow the festival circuit again. Unfortunately, I my health was still a bit up and down. I decided to try something different. There is a really cool bar here in Bloomington called The bishop, I can always count on three or four killer shows to come through a year, and tickets are usually under $20\. Its the kind of venue where if one shows up early, there is a good chance of kicking it with the very musician(s) about to play. It's a small venue where everyone gets really sweaty, and the place just smells like body odor by the end of the show.
