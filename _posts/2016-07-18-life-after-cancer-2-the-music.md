## Life After Cancer \#2 (the Music)

Years ago, before I got sick, I knew who I was. I was a photographer. I travelled, I partied, I photographed the bands that I loved to listen to (and many bands I couldn't stand as well.) For me, I just wanted to be behind the camera, and the photo pit is usually the best seat in the house. I was constantly meeting new and interesting people. Beautiful women wanted to talk to me at rock shows. Over time, some of the luster wore off, and it definitely felt like a job. However, when I lost my vision. When I lost the use of half my body. It was hard to imagine I would ever get back in the pit again.

Eventually, after about a year, my vision returned. My therapies continued, and I continued to heal and regain more function of my body. I photographed one of my biggest heroes, calvin Johnson. A friend got me credentialed to photograph the Stone Temple Pilots. I discovered I could, in fact, take pictures Years went by.
