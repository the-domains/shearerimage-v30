I was a photographer. I travelled, I partied, I photographed the bands I loved to listen to (I photographed bands I couldn’t stand as well.) I just wanted to be behind the camera, and the photo pit is usually the best seat in the house. I was constantly meeting new and interesting people. Beautiful women wanted to talk to me at rock shows. Over time, some of the luster wore off, and it definitely began to feel like a job. However, when I lost my vision. When I lost the use of half my body... It was hard to imagine I would ever get back into the pit again.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="43"><p data-reactid="44">After almost a month in the neuro critical care unit, I was moved to a rehabilitation hospital. I had to relearn how to walk, how to talk, how to use the restroom. It was a painful and awkward time. In so many ways, I felt like a newborn again. Eventually, after about a year, my vision returned. My therapies continued, and I continued to heal and regain more function in my body. A friend got me credentialed to photograph the Stone Temple Pilots when they played in Indianapolis. I had seen Stone Temple Pilots a couple times in the 90’s as a fan, and photographed velvet revolver before my diagnosis, so it was really exciting to be photographing STP post brain surgery. It was also a great therapy, as it gave me hope that I might be able to be a photographer again, even if I was a bit rusty at it. A few years later I photographed one of my biggest heroes, calvin Johnson, during an in store performance at a local record shop. It was also my son’s first concert. If you don’t know who calvin Johnson is, I’ve been listening to his bands since I was in high school. Not to mention his label, K records, put out the first two Modest Mouse and Beck albums. The man is a legend. When Amanda was in London, I listened to his solo album and stared forlornly out the rainy window, brain tumor in my head. “Love will come back again.” I photographed another friend’s band, tammar. I discovered I could, in fact, take pictures again.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="45"><p data-reactid="46">I am fortunate to live in Bloomington, IN. Yes, it is surrounded by Indiana, but it’s an island in many respects. I have always loved music, and this town draws many up and coming acts. At first, I started going to shows of bands that I like who were playing in town. I had never really been to any shows without a camera, so I couldn’t get comfortable at torro y moi or foxygen. Both shows were great, but it just felt weird to not have my camera at my side. Years went by.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="47"><p data-reactid="48">I toyed with the idea of getting back into work, hitting the road to follow the festival circuit again. Unfortunately, my health was still a bit up and down. I decided to try something different. There is a pretty cool bar here in Bloomington called The bishop. I can always count on three or four killer shows to come through a year, and tickets are usually under $20. Its the kind of venue where if one shows up early, there is a good chance of kicking it with the very musician(s) about to play. It’s a small venue where everyone gets really sweaty, and the place just smells like body odor by the end of the show. It reminded me of when I was first starting out, shooting bands at double door and Metro in Chicago. There’s a large selection of beers on tap, but I only drink Upland.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="49"><p data-reactid="50">’m from. I explain I’m a hoosier, but had a couple of brain surgeries that affected my speech. We chat about random things. It seems everyone these days knows somebody who went through cancer treatment. The fact that this is a Big 10 university town with many resources comes up. (I have another drink.) Sometimes I can round the group up for a quiBasically, I just started buying a ticket, showing up with my camera, and asking, “Hey, is it cool if I take some pictures of the show”? The answer is always yes. Sometimes they ask me not to use flash, or don’t photograph the first song, because she is playing a kazoo.” Sometimes they want to know who I’m shooting for. Of course, I’m shooting for myself. This seems to be a fine enough explanation. Sometimes they notice my accent, and ask where Ick photo after the show. It doesn’t matter if they are all sweaty and gross, I just want that offstage shot whenever possible. I’m usually getting home around 2 am on those nights.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left group-graphical-shape-circle  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="51"><div class="Component p-1 ls-fx-r j-c-center a-i-start " data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="53"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="54"><img class="color-loading" data-ratio="1.4210526315789473" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/441dad8f6534929bb083f0486ddfabfb/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2Fb3114ff1aafd693d8980a8045fb4c6e0%2Fcroprotate.jpg%3Fcropheight%3D304%26cropwidth%3D432%26degrees%3D0%26input%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.shearerimage.com%252Fcommercial-editpicks.%252Ftapedeck.jpg%26x%3D0%26y%3D64&amp;width=432" style="object-position:48.495370370370374% 69.57236842105263%;" data-reactid="55"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="56"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="57"><h1 data-reactid="58"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="59"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="60">Contact &quot; ShearerImage.com</a></span></h1></div><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="61"><h5 data-reactid="62"><span class="Author f-s-xxs  color-box-pop" data-reactid="63"><a href="http://www.shearerimage.com" data-reactid="64">Shearerimage</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 65 --></div></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="66"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="67"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="68"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="69"><span data-reactid="70"><!-- react-empty: 71 --><h2 data-reactid="72"><a data-reactid="73">shearerimage v3.0</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="74"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="75"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="76"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="77"></div></section></div></div>
