## Life After Cancer \#2 (the Music)

Years ago, before I got sick, I knew who I was. I was a photographer. I travelled, I partied, I photographed the bands I loved to listen to (and many bands I couldn't stand as well.) For me, I just wanted to be behind the camera, and the photo pit is usually the best seat in the house. I was constantly meeting new and interesting people. Beautiful women wanted to talk to me at rock shows. Over time, some of the luster wore off, and it definitely felt like a job. However, when I lost my vision. When I lost the use of half my body... It was hard to imagine I would ever get back in the pit again.

Eventually, after about a year, my vision returned. My therapies continued, and I continued to heal and regain more function of my body. I photographed one of my biggest heroes, calvin Johnson during an in store performance at a local record shop . If you don't know who calvin Johnson is, I've been listening to his bands since I was in high school. Not to mention, his label, K records, put out the first two Modest Mouse and Beck albums. The man is a legend. A friend then got me credentialed to photograph the Stone Temple Pilots when they played in Indianapolis. I had seen Stone Temple Pilots a couple times in the 90's as a fan, and photographed velvet revolver before my diagnosis, so it was really exciting to be photographing them post brain surgery. I photographed another friend's band, tammar. I discovered I could, in fact, take pictures again. 

I am fortunate to live in Bloomington, IN. Yes, it is surrounded by Indiana, but it's an island in many respects. I have always loved music, and this town draws many up and coming acts. At first, I started going to shows of bands that I like who were playing in town. I had never really been to any shows without a camera, so I couldn't get comfortable at torro y moi or foxygen. Both shows were great, but it just felt weird to not have my camera at my side. Years went by.

I toyed with the idea of getting back into work, hitting the road to follow the festival circuit again. Unfortunately, I my health was still a bit up and down. I decided to try something different. There is a really cool bar here in Bloomington called The bishop, I can always count on three or four killer shows to come through a year, and tickets are usually under $20\. Its the kind of venue where if one shows up early, there is a good chance of kicking it with the very musician(s) about to play. It's a small venue where everyone gets really sweaty, and the place just smells like body odor by the end of the show. There's a large selection of beers on tap, but I only drink Upland. (the local brewery) Basically, I just started buying a ticket, showing up with my camera, and asking, "Hey, is it cool if I take some pictures of the show"? The answer is always yes. Sometimes they ask me not to use flash, or don't photograph the first song, because she is playing a kazoo." Sometimes they want to know who I'm shooting for. Of course, I'm shooting for myself. This seems to be a fine enough explanation. Sometimes they notice my accent, and ask where I'm from. I explain I'm a hoosier, but had a couple of brain surgeries that affected my speech.
