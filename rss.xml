            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Life After Cancer #2 (the Music)</h1><p>Years ago, before I got sick, I knew who I was. I was a photographer. I travelled, I partied, I photographed the bands I loved to listen to (and many bands I couldnâ€™t stand as well.) For me, I just wanted to be behind the camera, and the photo pit is usually the best seat in the house. I was constantly meeting new and interesting people. Beautiful women wanted to talk to me at rock shows. Over time, some of the luster wore off, and it definitely felt like a job. However, when I lost my vision. When I lost the use of half my body... It was hard to imagine I would ever get back in the pit again.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/02e6f2f629593ec4e1e7fc3387dbbef9/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=2913&cropwidth=4368&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fefef795c-a095-4bbf-969a-9d9418fb98c2.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
